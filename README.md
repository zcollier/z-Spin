Arduino Pro Micro arcade spinner controller with gamepad buttons and d-pad

This is simple code for Arduino Pro Micro that creates an arcade-style spinner using a rotary encoder and a bunch of buttons. 

The cool thing about this particular spinner is that is includes a full gamepad so that you can use it as your only input device on MiSTer to navigate all menus, start up a game of Arkanoid, and then use the spinner and a button, emulating a mouse, to play.

I have built my prototype into an Atari 2600 Paddle controller enclosure, and it's perfect for my needs.
